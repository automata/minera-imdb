  LOGGING
  =======

Since version 4.4 IMDbPY provides a logging facility, using the
powerful "logging" module.
You can find documentation about it here:
  http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html

By default information are logged on standard error; you can read
on the module documentation how to stream them elsewhere.

The default logging level is "warning"; this can be changed
modifying the "loggingLevel" key of your imdbpy.cfg file.
