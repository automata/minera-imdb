  COMPANIES DATA
  ==============

Since IMDbPY 3.6, companies have their own class and every reference
to a company is now an instance of the Company class.

  NOTES
  =====

- no references (inside text field) about companies are retrieved,
  so far; I don't even think there are any in the IMDb web site, but
  I may be wrong.

- 'mobile' data access system collects companies informations through
  the 'httpThin' method; it should be fast enough.
